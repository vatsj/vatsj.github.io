# My personal website!

Meant primarily to host my resume/CV/jobby stuff, also a nice place to store personal projects.

## Dev stuff:
The site is built using github pages. See their documentation for a better description than this one.

### Dependencies
- Jekyll (https://jekyllrb.com/, requires ruby install)
- Bundler (https://bundler.io/, recommended to simplify Jekyll interfacing)

### How to run
To run, use the following bash command:
> bundle exec jekyll serve
