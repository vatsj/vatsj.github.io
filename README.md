# My personal website!

Meant primarily to host my resume/CV/jobby stuff, also a nice place to store personal projects.

The site is built using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). See their documentation for a better description than this one.

### Dependencies
- Jekyll (https://jekyllrb.com/, requires ruby install)
- Bundler (https://bundler.io/, recommended to simplify Jekyll interfacing)

You may also have to install gems (via Ruby) and call `bundle install`.

### How to run
To run, use the following shell command:
> bundle exec jekyll serve

Alternatively, you can use raw Jekyll (instead of using bundle as a wrapper) with the following commands
> jekyll build
> jekyll serve
