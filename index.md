# About
Hi! I'm Jacob, a junior at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) studying Math and Computer Science. My academic interests are broad, ranging from machine learning and software development to data science and quantitative trading. In my free time, I swim, listen to [podcasts](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/adventure-zone/), and discover new and inventive ways to break my code.

Here are my things: [resume](res/resume.pdf), [github](https://github.com/vatsj), [linkedin](https://bit.ly/vatsj-linkedin)

# Work Experience
During Summer 2021, I interned with [Five Rings Capital](https://fiverings.com/), completing a research project under the mentorship of a full-time Quantitative Researcher and competing against other interns in (proprietary) training games.

In 2020, I worked at the [Openproof Foundation](https://openproof.gradegrinder.net/), developing a node.js frontend for mathematical logic courseware.

In 2019, I interned with [ASR Analytics](https://www.asranalytics.com/), developing a graph-based recommender engine to inform IRS tax compliance interventions.

In 2018, I participated in the [University of Maryland REU Program](http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/reucaar/index.html), researching a finite graph approach to the Hadwiger-Nelson problem ([preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07987) of our paper).

# Research

## [SERI](https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/stanford-existential-risks-initiative/content/stanford-existential-risks-initiative)
During Winter and Spring 2021, I researched the Outer AI Alignment problem under the mentorship of [Alex Turner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandermattturner/), extending Turner's definition of [POWER](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/7CdoznhJaLEKHwvJW/p/6DuJxY8X45Sco4bS2) to multi-agent games. I presented this research at the [Winter](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VXlzPB9OGyiNbS4-hkJArUdtocKn1hp8x3Ig17wQ_dI/edit?usp=sharing) and [Spring](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pvcZfX3rDiwUdbZlsI4R2uHRpbuuLFwL27xk-6LKRpU/edit?usp=sharing) SERI conferences as well as coauthoring several [blog posts](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/midco) as informal writeups.

## Stanford DRP
During Winter 2019-20, I studied Algebraic Topology ([Hatcher](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/AT.pdf)) under the mentorship of [Joseph Helfer](http://web.stanford.edu/~joj/). I also gave a talk presenting the topic to undergraduate students ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10HAyP_gTQvZOSyaA1bIC1VgTaTGF1c6Ry8QnohF-6VM/edit?usp=sharing)).

# Projects

## Commitment-bot
To help my friends in a discord server set personal goals, I coded a [bot](https://github.com/vatsj/commitment-bot) to let users set and evaluate personal goals.

## D&D Campaign
I got bored one day and wrote the outline for a Dungeons & Dragons campaign, which you can read [here](https://www.notion.so/D-D-Campaign-God-in-the-Machine-a20c74b3815841ba8ee846de45c7e80b). Taking inspiration from [TAZ Balance](https://theadventurezone.fandom.com/wiki/Campaign_1:_The_Balance_Arc), my outline plays fast and loose with D&D structure/mechanics in favor of a storytelling-centric approach.

<!-- ## Gamer-bot
In an effort to teach myself Reinforcement Learning techniques through game-playing, I wrote a [general framework](https://github.com/vatsj/gamer-bot) for algorithmic multiplayer game-playing. Alice (my alpha-beta pruning algorithm with clever tweaks, named in honor of cryptographic legends Alice and Bob) can tie me at tic-tac-toe, but not at chess. -->

## MBHS Math Team
During high school ([Montgomery Blair HS](https://mbhs.edu/)), I was a member and later co-captain of the [Blair Math Team](https://twitter.com/mbhsmathteam?lang=en). For our weekly lectures (and random other reasons), I wrote up notes on various math topics, with a specific focus on audience participation and making learning fun. Some highlights are listed below:
- [Football](https://www.overleaf.com/read/tpjyrjdkywnv)
- [Large Number Game](https://www.overleaf.com/read/skwwxmnqcftz)

### Magnet Survey
During Fall 2020, I worked with fellow Magnet alumni [Laura Cui](https://reionize.github.io/) and [Steven Qu](http://www.xrsqu.com/) to design and take a survey of students' experiences in the STEM Magnet program. Our results are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oLIlN4I1W-nN9r-OgZGWCubeCtivVRLK?usp=sharing), or see the [Magnet Foundation press release](http://www.mbhsmagnet.org/news/fall20/alumni-survey).
