# About
Hi! I'm Jacob, a sophomore at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) studying Math and Computer Science. In my free time, I swim, listen to podcasts, and discover new and inventive ways to break my code.

Here are my things: [resume](), [github](), [linkedin]()

# Work Experience
Last summer (2020), I worked at the [Openproof Foundation](), developing a node.js frontend for mathematical logic courseware. In 2019, I worked at [ASR Analytics](), developing a graph-based recommender engine to inform IRS tax compliance interventions. In 2018, I participated in the [University of Maryland REU Program](http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/reucaar/index.html), researching a finite graph approach to the Hadwiger-Nelson problem ([preprint]() of our paper).

# Projects

## Stanford DRP
During Winter 2019-20, I studied Algebraic Topology ([Hatcher]()) under the mentorship of [Joseph Helfer]. I also gave a talk presenting the topic to undergraduate students ([slides]()).

## Commitment-bot
To help my friends in a discord server set personal goals, I coded a [bot]() to let users set and evaluate personal goals.

## MBHS Math Team
During high school ([Montgomery Blair HS]()), I was a member and later co-captain of the [Blair Math Team](https://twitter.com/mbhsmathteam?lang=en). For our weekly lectures (and random other reasons), I wrote up notes on various math topics, with a specific focus on audience participation and making learning fun. Some highlights are listed below:
