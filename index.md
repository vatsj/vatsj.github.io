# About
Hi! Iâ€™m Jacob, a Masters' student at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) studying Artificial Intelligence. My academic interests are broad but roughly center on understanding ML systems through their applications. Among my many hobbies, I enjoy sports, cooking, and [D&D podcasts](https://www.themcelroy.family/).

Here are links to my [resume](res/resume.pdf), [github](https://github.com/vatsj), and [linkedin](https://bit.ly/vatsj-linkedin). You can leave me anonymous feedback [here](https://www.admonymous.co/vatsj).

# Internship Experience

This past summer (2024), I was a Visiting Researcher at the [Alignment Research Center](https://www.alignment.org/theory/), where I formalized a [surprise account](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SyeQjjBoEC48MvnQC/formal-verification-heuristic-explanations-and-surprise) of the Linear Argmax model. You can find the writeup [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ww865Rb6WJ-T9zqIb9tXfyGNw6XfoVi7/view?usp=sharing).

In 2023, I was a Research Fellow at the [Existential Risks Alliance](https://erafellowship.org/), where I investigated [Contrast-Consistent Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03827) as a detector of LLM Truthfulness under the mentorship of [Tilman Rauker](https://www.raeuker.com/). I've since continued and expanded this research direction at Stanford under the mentorship of Prof. [Vasilis Syrgkanis](https://vsyrgkanis.com/).

In 2022, I interned with [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/) and ~~played [figgie](https://figgie.com/) all day~~ used a diverse software suite (python, excel, bloomberg, SQL) to research and develop trading strategies.

In 2021, I interned with [Five Rings Capital](https://fiverings.com/), researching under the mentorship of a full-time quant and competing in proprietary training games.

In 2020, I worked at the [Openproof Foundation](https://openproof.gradegrinder.net/), developing a node.js frontend for mathematical logic courseware.

In 2019, I interned with [ASR Analytics](https://www.asranalytics.com/), developing a graph-based recommender engine to inform IRS tax compliance interventions.

In 2018, I participated in the [University of Maryland REU Program](http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/reucaar/index.html), researching a finite graph approach to the Hadwiger-Nelson problem. The resulting [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07987) was published in the journal [Geombinatorics](https://geombina.uccs.edu/past-issues/volume-xxxii).

# Research

## [SERI](https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/stanford-existential-risks-initiative/content/stanford-existential-risks-initiative)
During Winter and Spring 2021, I researched the Outer AI Alignment problem under the mentorship of [Alex Turner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandermattturner/), extending Turner's definition of [POWER](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/7CdoznhJaLEKHwvJW/p/6DuJxY8X45Sco4bS2) to multi-agent games. I presented at the [Winter](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VXlzPB9OGyiNbS4-hkJArUdtocKn1hp8x3Ig17wQ_dI/edit?usp=sharing) and [Spring](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pvcZfX3rDiwUdbZlsI4R2uHRpbuuLFwL27xk-6LKRpU/edit?usp=sharing) SERI conferences and coauthored several [blog posts](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/midco) as informal writeups.

## Stanford DRP
During Winter 2019-20, I studied Algebraic Topology ([Hatcher](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/AT.pdf)) under the mentorship of [Joseph Helfer](https://www.jojhelfer.com/). I also gave a talk presenting the topic to undergraduate students ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10HAyP_gTQvZOSyaA1bIC1VgTaTGF1c6Ry8QnohF-6VM/edit?usp=sharing)).

# Projects

## Level 9001
As a [MBMBAM](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/my-brother-my-brother-and-me/) enjoyer, I have dearly missed the departed Yahoo! Answers QA service. To remedy this, I find=tuned a language model to simulate the [answers](https://mbmbam.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Final_Yahoo!s) submitted to the podcast.

## Commitment-bot
To help my friends in a discord server set personal goals, I coded a [bot](https://github.com/vatsj/commitment-bot) to let users set and evaluate time-bound goals.

<!-- ## D&D Campaign
I got bored one day and wrote the outline for a Dungeons & Dragons campaign, which you can read [here](https://www.notion.so/D-D-Campaign-God-in-the-Machine-a20c74b3815841ba8ee846de45c7e80b). Taking inspiration from [TAZ Balance](https://theadventurezone.fandom.com/wiki/Campaign_1:_The_Balance_Arc), my outline plays fast and loose with D&D structure/mechanics in favor of a storytelling-centric approach. -->

## Gamer-bot
In an effort to teach myself Reinforcement Learning techniques through game-playing, I wrote a [general framework](https://github.com/vatsj/gamer-bot) for algorithmic multiplayer game-playing. Alice (my alpha-beta pruning algorithm with clever tweaks, named in honor of cryptographic legends Alice and Bob) can tie me at tic-tac-toe, but not at chess.

## MBHS Math Team
During high school ([Montgomery Blair HS](https://mbhs.edu/)), I was a member and later co-captain of the [Blair Math Team](https://twitter.com/mbhsmathteam?lang=en). During that time, I wrote up lecture notes on various math topics, with a specific focus on audience participation and making learning fun. Some highlights are listed below:
- [Football](https://www.overleaf.com/read/tpjyrjdkywnv)
- [Large Number Game](https://www.overleaf.com/read/skwwxmnqcftz)

## Magnet Survey
During Fall 2020, I worked with fellow Magnet alumni [Laura Cui](https://reionize.github.io/) and [Steven Qu](http://www.xrsqu.com/) to design and take a survey of students' experiences in the STEM Magnet program. Our results are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oLIlN4I1W-nN9r-OgZGWCubeCtivVRLK?usp=sharing), or see the [Magnet Foundation press release](https://www.mbhsmagnet.org/news/fall20/surveying-recent-alumni-and-students-on-magnet-experiences).

# Miscellaneous projects
- A [D&D campaign module](https://www.notion.so/D-D-Campaign-God-in-the-Machine-a20c74b3815841ba8ee846de45c7e80b), designed for storytelling in the style of [TAZ Balance](https://theadventurezone.fandom.com/wiki/Campaign_1:_The_Balance_Arc)
- [Meta-chess](https://www.overleaf.com/read/hshwfqvhtgcj), a team-based strategy game designed for a group of chess enthusiasts. I planned to organize a game at [Mathcamp](https://www.mathcamp.org/) but never got around to it :(
