# About
Hi! I'm Jacob, a sophomore at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) studying Math and Computer Science. In my free time, I swim, listen to [podcasts](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/adventure-zone/), and discover new and inventive ways to break my code.

Here are my things: [resume](res/Resume.pdf), [github](https://github.com/vatsj), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-stavrianos-aa88491a5/)

# Work Experience
Last summer (2020), I worked at the [Openproof Foundation](https://openproof.gradegrinder.net/), developing a node.js frontend for mathematical logic courseware. In 2019, I worked at [ASR Analytics](https://www.asranalytics.com/), developing a graph-based recommender engine to inform IRS tax compliance interventions. In 2018, I participated in the [University of Maryland REU Program](http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/reucaar/index.html), researching a finite graph approach to the Hadwiger-Nelson problem ([preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07987) of our paper).

# Projects

## Stanford DRP
During Winter 2019-20, I studied Algebraic Topology ([Hatcher](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/AT.pdf)) under the mentorship of [Joseph Helfer](http://web.stanford.edu/~joj/). I also gave a talk presenting the topic to undergraduate students ([slides](res/DRP_slides.pdf)).

## Commitment-bot
To help my friends in a discord server set personal goals, I coded a [bot](https://github.com/vatsj/commitment-bot) to let users set and evaluate personal goals.

## [Montgomery Blair HS](https://mbhs.edu/)

## MBHS Math Team
During high school ([Montgomery Blair HS](https://mbhs.edu/)), I was a member and later co-captain of the [Blair Math Team](https://twitter.com/mbhsmathteam?lang=en). For our weekly lectures (and random other reasons), I wrote up notes on various math topics, with a specific focus on audience participation and making learning fun. Some highlights are listed below:
- [Football](res/Football.pdf)
- [Large Number Game](res/Large_Numbers.pdf)

### Magnet Survey
This fall (2020), I worked with fellow Magnet alumni [Laura Cui](https://reionize.github.io/) and [Steven Qu](http://www.xrsqu.com/) to design and take a survey of students' experiences in the STEM Magnet program. Our results are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oLIlN4I1W-nN9r-OgZGWCubeCtivVRLK?usp=sharing).
